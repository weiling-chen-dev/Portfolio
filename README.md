# Clone-Practice Project - My Portfolio Website

This website is for learning and practicing Webpack Config and SCSS. I also add a simple backend function to send an email with [SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com/).

## front-end

- React.js
- Webpack Configuration (bundle to ./fullApp/client)
- SCSS (Mixins/Variables/Nesting/Partials)

## back-end

- Node.js and [SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com/) for emailing

# Reference

The layout, color and functions are based on the following beautiful website. I revise the content of the web page to myself introduction.
It only used for practice purpose, not business purpose. Thank you.
